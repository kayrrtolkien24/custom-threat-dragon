Kademos Custom Dragon is **built on the shoulders of giants**.  
Our application is a private fork of the outstanding open-source project **[OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/)**.

We are deeply grateful to the OWASP Foundation and every contributor who has invested time and passion into Threat Dragon. Their work provides the solid, battle-tested core on which Kademos builds.

## Nature of This Fork

Kademos Custom Dragon:

* **Purpose** – Internal use by Kademos engineering & security teams  
* **Enhancements** – Branding, Jira Cloud integration, Mermaid text-to-diagram, expanded STRIDE rule engine, and workflow simplification  
* **Upstream compatibility** – We strive to stay close to upstream where feasible but this fork is **not** an official OWASP release.

All upstream copyrights, licenses, and notices remain intact in the source.
